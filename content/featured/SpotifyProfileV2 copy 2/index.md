Mishkas wanted me to create a series of illustrations that would be used to advertise their best selling drinks as well as a soon to be released latte. I proposed a style that's reminiscient of herbarium samples-- dried plants that are catalogued and stored for future research.

I created 6 posters, wrote the copy for several paid Instagram and Google ads, and measured our online campaign performance over the course of several weeks.
