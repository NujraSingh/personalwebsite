Mishkas' owner, Sinisa, wanted me to create a series of illustrations that would be used for marketing campaign to advertise Mishkas' bestsellers as well as a soon to be released latte. I proposed a style that is reminiscient of herbarium samples-- dried plants that are catalogued and stored for future research.

I created 6 posters, wrote the copy for several paid Instagram and Google ads, and measured our online campaign performance over the course of several weeks. We then created a limited edition release of 25 prints per design which sold out within a week.
