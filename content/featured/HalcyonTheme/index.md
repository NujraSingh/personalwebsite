[SO-COL](https://socol.io) is a decentralized platform that enables content creators to monetize their social media posts and earn subscription-based income by collaborating directly with fans.

While directing SO-COL's marketing team, I proposed this design direction for our website. I then designed several of the assets on our site and wrote portions of our copy, editing and overseeing the rest.
