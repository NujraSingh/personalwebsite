[SO-COL](https://socol.io) is a decentralized platform that enables content creators to monetize their social media posts and earn subscription-based income by collaborating directly with fans.

While directing SO-COL's marketing team, I proposed the copy and design direction for our website. I then created several of the design assets on our landing page and led the execution of our testnet launch marketing campaign across our social media channels.
