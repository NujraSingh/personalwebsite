My team and I used Google Optimize to track and analyze user behavior on our website such as page views, click-through rates, time spent on the website and bounce rate. Based on the data, we decided to use A/B testing to improve user experience and increase conversions.

I proposed changes such as adjusting the targeted messaging, and changing the layout of specific assets on our landing page. As a result, we were able to increase website traffic by 18%, sign-ups by 21%, active users by 11% and decrease our bounce rate by 32%.
