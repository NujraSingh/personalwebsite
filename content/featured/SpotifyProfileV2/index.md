IreneDAO asked me to expand their reach to users that were unfamiliar with blockchains, NFTs, and DAOs. They wanted to share how web3 is trying to restore the autonomy that has long been taken from users through intermediaries and centralization.

After writing copy for several of their paid social media campaigns, they went on to have an incredibly successful launch. My proposals for allocating Treasury funds resulted in us donating 100,000 USD to ECPAT and 10,000 USD to The Ocean Cleanup.
