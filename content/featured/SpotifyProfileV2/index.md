Irene wanted me to demystify web3 jargon, and expand her reach to users that were unfamiliar with blockchains, NFT's, DAO's and other potentially intimidating concepts.

I wrote and edited twitter threads on Irene's 189.7k follower account and the DAO's 21.2k follower account. I refined our partnership strategy and led outreach to several content creators. I also helped grow the Discord to over 5k members, assisted in writing the DAO Constitution, and made revisions to the plans for allocating 700k in treasury funds.
