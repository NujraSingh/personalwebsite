Irene asked me to demystify web3 jargon and expand her reach to users that were unfamiliar with blockchains, NFTs, and DAOs.

We wanted to share the philosophy behind her DAO-- how web3 is trying to restore the autonomy that has long been taken from users through intermediaries and centralization. I workshopped a series of Twitter threads with this in mind, resulting in an 11% increase in followers and a significant spike in engagement in the following weeks.

We went on to have an incredibly successful launch, and my proposals for allocating Treasury funds resulted in us donating 100,000 USD to ECPAT and 10,000 USD to The Ocean Cleanup.
