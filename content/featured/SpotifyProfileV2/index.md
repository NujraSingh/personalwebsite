Irene wanted me to demystify web3 jargon, and expand her reach to users that were unfamiliar with blockchains, NFT's, DAO's and other potentially intimidating concepts.

I wrote and edited twitter threads on Irene's 189.7k follower account and the DAO's 21.2k follower account. While managing a 3 person team, I helped grow our Discord to over 5k members, oversaw the writing of the DAO Constitution and made final revisions to the plans for allocating 700k in treasury funds.
