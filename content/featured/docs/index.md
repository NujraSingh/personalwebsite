I collaborated with Oxford graduate students and AI alignment researchers to provide feedback on an accelerated AI Safety Course that will adapted for undergraduate university students. During a 4-week period, I attended weekly seminars and wrote detailed feedback for all 64 chapters of an early-stage textbook.

I worked most closely on the machine ethics, single-agent control, safety engineering, and multi-agent dynamics sections. This included adapting many of the proposed visual representations of utility functions, and other mathematics-heavy sections of the textbook to improve readability and ease of comprehension.
