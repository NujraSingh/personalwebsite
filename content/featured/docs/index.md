I collaborated with Oxford graduate students, computer scientists, and AI alignment researchers to provide feedback on an accelerated AI Safety Course that will adapted for undergraduate university students. During a 4-week period, I attended weekly seminars and provided detailed feedback to all 64 chapters of their textbook.

I worked most closely on the machine ethics, single-agent control, safety engineering, and multi-agent dynamics sections. I adapted many of the proposed examples in these sections to better capitalize on the existing familiarity that students will have with AI. This included making changes to many of the representations of utility functions, and other mathematics-heavy sections of the textbook with the hope of improving student comprehension.
